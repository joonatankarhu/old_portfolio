      I am a Full-Stack Web Developer born in Finland and raised in Sweden. Currently I'm based in Helsinki, Finland. I enjoy problem solving, learning and building new things, so programming became a natural fit for me. I began programming as a hobby first in 2020, but soon realized that I wanted to turn it into a career. Now I have been working as a professional developer since 2023.
          <br/><br/>
         When I'm not coding, I enjoy spending time with friends and family, playing video games, and staying active at the gym. I'm always eager to learn new skills and embrace challenges, both in my personal life and in my career.
