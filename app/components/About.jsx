        My name is Joonatan Karhu. I am a self taught Fullstack Web Developer
        with two years of experience in self studies and building projects. At
        the moment I'm working on a freelance eCommerce project and I am also
        studying full-time in Buutti's Fullstack Web developer Program. I have
        strong understanding and lots of experience with HTML, CSS and
        JavaScript. When building applications I use modern technologies such as
        React.js, Node.js, Express and TailwindCSS. I specialize in Responsive
        Web Design and building interactive and modern user interfaces. I speak
        fluent English and Finnish. Swedish is my mother tongue. In my free time
        I enjoy spending time with my friends and family. And going to the gym
        and play computer games.
